### A game

This application was intended to finish in java. For some reasons, I left it there for years, and decide to pick it up in a more familiar language now. 

The program shall be rewritten entirely. (March 2020)

This project is a part of the final assignment this semester now. (June 2020)

Recent tests are stable.

***--- REMINDER***

To pack (on windows), run
```
pyinstaller window.py --onefile -w --icon res/icon.ico --add-data 'res/icon.ico;res/icon.ico'
```
(the `--add-data` part doesn't necessarily save the icon, but at least main features survive the process)
