### A game, to be finished
- that is to say, not finished yet

This application was intended to finish in java. For some reasons, I left it there for years, and decide to pick it up in a more familiar language now. 

The program shall be rewritten entirely. (March 2020)

This project is a part of the final assignment this semester now. (June 2020)
